# Quickie RPG

<p class="subtitle">
A quick and simple tabletop system for one-off games
</p>

<section>

When I was in college I was briefly part of a tabletop gaming club. At the
first meeting of each academic quarter, the club split into gaming tables
which would last the next three months. I missed that first meeting, so I
started a table of "leftovers" like me who couldn't commit to a recurring
weekly game.

Given the non-committal nature of our group, I didn't want to waste time
getting the players up to speed on a large tome of rules. I had previously
been inspired by the simplicity of Fabletop,<side-note
name="mn-fabletop">Fabletop http://fabletop.com/help/introduction</side-note> an
online-only RPG. So I tinkered with the rules to favor in-person play and
switched to six-sided dice since I had a bunch of them available.

This system is the result. It's a short read, allows quick character
creation, and encourages character death or retirement by the end of the
session. We called it "Zero Commitment RPG."

## Making a character

Start the character with a name and a two- or three-sentence description,
which should focus on their personality, background story, and goals.

Each character has three basic traits and two bonus traits.

The three basic traits are **Agility, Mind,** and **Might**. All three must
add up to seven points, and each must be at least one point. A split of 2–2–3
is recommended, putting the three in whichever trait is most central to your
character.

The **two bonus traits** connect your character’s background to the mechanics
of the game. Each should describe some aspect or skillset of your character,
such as Archer, Ninja, Smooth Talker, Terrifying, etc. Each bonus trait
counts as one point. If you'd like to play a specific class, use it as one of
your traits.

Starting **Health** is (Might + 1). When health reaches 0, the character is
dead.

Each character starts with (Mind + 1) expendable **Power Points**. Throughout
play these will be used up, so write them where they can be crossed off. They
are restored at the start of each scene.

## Performing actions

When a character attempts an action, they roll multiple dice (or the same die
multiple times). The number of dice to roll is the points of whichever base
trait is most applicable plus any bonus traits that apply.<side-note name="mn-dice-examples" margin>
Examples:
⚀⚁⚄⚅ (1, 2, 5, 6) gives 2 stars due to the 5 and 6, and gives no twist.
⚀⚀⚄⚅ (1, 1, 5, 6) gives 2 stars and a bad twist, due to double 1s.
⚀⚀⚅⚅ (1, 1, 6, 6) gives 2 stars and a good twist, due to double 6s and because good twists take precedence.
</side-note>

- Each 5 or 6 counts as a star
- If there are two 5s or two 6s, add a good twist
- Otherwise if there are two 1s or two 2s, add a bad twist

Success is determined by the number of stars vs. the difficulty of the
action. For most challenges, 1 star is enough. Especially difficult
challenges require 2 stars.

Only one bad or good twist may occur; good twists take precedence.

A **good twist** means the action has some beneficial side-effect besides the
goal of the action itself. Examples: noticing extra details, regaining HP,
getting a positive perk for the rest of the scene.

A **bad twist** means the action has some detrimental side-effect besides the
goal of the action itself. Examples: tripping, making a loud noise, nicking
oneself and losing HP, getting a negative perk for the rest of the scene.

## Power Points & magic

Power Points can be added to a roll to provide a guaranteed star. The
player must declare they are using a Power Point before they roll the dice.

Once used, a Power Point is crossed off the character sheet. It can be
regained through rest; see below.

Additionally, Power Points are used when magic-wielding characters perform
their arcane craft. When the mage performs their spell for the first time,
they expend a Power Point. Thereafter they can reuse the spell without using
any Power Points, if it is a simple spell (fireball, healing light wounds,
shining a light, etc.) More complex, impressive spells cannot be reused.

## Rest & recovery

After each scene, or whenever it makes sense that the characters could rest
and eat for a couple hours, Health and Power Points are fully restored.

## Making the story

The GM should actively seek ways to include players in the creation of the
story. This generally involves dividing players up, either into sub-groups or
as individuals, and having them form stories about others.

Here are common forms of collaboration:

A **wheel** is when each player writes a story about the character sitting
next to them. The GM gives each player a prompt, announces the direction
(either the character to your right or your left), and then gives players
time to respond.

A **grouping** is when the players divide into two or three sub-groups. Each
sub-group receives a prompt to write a story about the characters in the
other group(s).

A **shuffle** is when each player writes something about their character on a
slip of paper, then the papers are randomly shuffled among players. Each
player then adds on to what was written, contributing some twist or secret to
the character’s story.

## When the end is nigh

As the session draws to a close, it’s time for characters to start dying. Or
retiring, disappearing into the woods, getting lost at sea, being sucked into
an alternate plane, falling into an eternal slumber, etc.

Consider ending the session with an epic boss battle. When characters die,
have them assume the roles of the enemy, or allow their ghosts to participate
somehow.

For a less severe ending, have the players decide how their characters might
disappear happily into the sunset—perhaps how they retire with their riches.
Form a conclusion to your story.

Regardless of whether they die or retire, characters should go "out of
commission." Next session, new characters will be played instead.

Although the characters go away, the world may remain the same. Try to
incorporate the fallen characters’ stories and actions into the world for
next session—game settings should get better with age, marinating in the
flavorful stories of former characters.
